This repository contains an analysis of Maji Ndogo

**Project Background**

This comprehensive analysis examines the Maji Ndogo Water national survey results, focusing on water infrastructure performance, service delivery gaps, and improvement opportunities across multiple provinces. The dashboard presents critical insights into water access patterns, infrastructure quality, and regional disparities in service provision.


**Dataset Scope:**

**Total Population Served: 146.74M people (33.55% coverage)
Geographic Coverage: 6 provinces with detailed breakdowns
Service Categories: Multiple water source types and quality levels
Infrastructure Assessment: Aggregated improvement needs analysis
Budget Allocation: Cost analysis for improvement implementations**

Analytical Framework:
The analysis employs comprehensive DAX Expressions and data visualization to identify service gaps, regional performance variations, and strategic investment priorities for water infrastructure development.

**Executive Summary**
The Maji Ndogo Water survey reveals significant opportunities for water infrastructure expansion and quality improvement across the nation. With only 33.55% population coverage currently achieved, substantial investment and strategic planning are required to meet national water access goals.
